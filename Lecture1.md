# Level-1 Header: 1 pound sign

**Double asterisks to bold the texts**?

- Create a unordered list with "minus" sign,
- Make the text _Italic_ by wrapping with underscores,
- Italic and bold can be combined **_Row Crops_**.

## <a name="sec1"></a>1. Level-2 header: 2 pound signs

**A line break** is treated as a space in _markdown_.
The raw text is on a new line whereas the rendered result continues the
sentence in the same paragraph. 
<span style="text-decoration:underline">this</span> can be created with the u tag as well.

![Reference an image](assets/images/m1_Categorized.png)

Normal Html image tag is supported, which provides more control over the size of the image.
<img src="./assets/images/m1_Categorized.png" width="500" alt="use an image">

> :bulb: A callout can be created in this format:<br>
> "br" tag to force a line break
> followed since the early time of land-use suitability modeling.

### 1.1 Level-3 header: 3 pound signs

The first step to create a suitability model is to identify the criteria for
the subject of the model.
Each criterion identified should be instrumental in reaching the overall goal
of the model.
For example, if we want to locate a suitable site for an orchard, we might
consider four criteria:

- Soil permeability
- Distance to major roads
- Land value per unit area
- Current land use

[Module 2](./Lecture2.md),
**LUCIS-OPEN Tools for QGIS** consists of various geospatial tools to measure
different criteria defined in a suitability analysis, such as *Distance*,
*Density*, and *Zonal Statistics* tools.
